Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'path' in '/Users/e5691595/Documents/md/apps/css-to-js/node_modules/@americanexpress/css-to-js/lib/esm'

BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
	- add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "path": require.resolve("path-browserify") }'
	- install 'path-browserify'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
	resolve.fallback: { "path": false }
